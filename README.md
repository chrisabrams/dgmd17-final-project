## Start Project

Run `python server.py`.

Start project in Unity.

## Setting up Unity

In Unity Hub, under the installs tab, add a new install: `2020.3.12f1`. This is the latest LTS, everything should support this version. You'll be asked which targets to install; you really only need the OS you are running (Windows support for Windows, etc).

### Coding

If you don't have Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code, I recommend installing one of those as Unity makes it quite easy to link code snippets between the Visual Studio programs and Unity (you can edit the files in the Visual Studio programs and Unity will update in real-time, no need to re-compile).

### Assets

In the event that Unity does not automatically share Asset Store assets, here are the assets I added from the Unity Asset Store (free assets, requires a free Unity Account).
